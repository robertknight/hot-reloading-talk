# Hot Reloading with React and Redux

github.com/robertknight/hot-reloading-talk

.hint[Press 'P' for slide notes]

???
- This talk was originally called "Fast iteration on complex applications with Redux".
- That's not very snappy. I'm going to try again - this is "Hot Reloading with React and Redux".
- I'm expecting quite a mix of experience here, I'm going to try and make
  this accessible to people who are not familiar with React or Redux and
  hopefully there are some ideas here which might be useful even if you're
  not using either.

???
- This talk is about something I had no idea how much I wanted
  until I tried it.
- Building user interfaces is all about tweaking things, being able to make
  changes and see the effects quickly.
- With static content and simple web apps, where you can express the state
  in the URL, this is pretty easy. You can set up something like BrowserSync
  or LiveReload to just reload the page when it detects a change to a file.

---

???
- With a more complex and stateful app, this doesn't work so well. After
  each tweak you spend a bunch of time getting the app back to the state
  it was before

???
- Hot reloading is a feature that lets you change not just
  the styling, but most of your code, and see the results immediately without
  having to reload the page.
- Popularized by React Hot Loader. Cool tech demo, but described by its
  creator as a hack.

# Demo

???
- Demo app is a simple dashboard that lets you compare commit
  activity from different GitHub projects over the past year.
- { Brief demo of functionality: Add chart, remove chart, zoom in }
- { Point out that we have multiple charts, so not trivial to put state into URL }
- { Hot reload demo: Increase height of zoomed-in chart }
- { Hot reload demo: Tweak chart style }
- { Hot reload demo: Tweak loading screen. This is where Redux comes in. }

---

# Outline

- How hot reloading works
- Hot reloading views
- Principles of Elm/Redux and how they enable hot reloading
- Remaining challenges

???
- There are many boilerplate projects online that will give you a basic
  setup with Webpack/React/Redux that has hot reloading
- Relying on boilerplate is OK, as long as it works flawlessly
- This talk is going to focus on how hot reloading works under the hood
  and the how the principles behind Elm/Redux enable hot reloading and
  many other useful debugging and development tools.
- React and Redux are well suited to hot reloading but you can still make use
  of the ideas even if you have a different stack. Redux in particular is not
  coupled to any view library.

---

# Ingredients for Hot Reloading

1. Delivering code updates to the browser

???
- Three main things we need to do in order to implement hot reloading
- The first is taking a code change to a file and getting it from disk
  to the browser
--

1. Updating views

???
- Once the app has the updated code available to it, it needs to load it
  somehow and update the components on screen to reflect those changes,
  preserving as much state as possible.
- This is where Redux comes in

--

1. Preserving state, even if the model changes

???
- Lastly, if you make a change that affects the models in your app,
  we want to try and preserve as much state as possible
---

# Delivering code updates to the browser

???
* The first part of enabling hot reloading is delivering code updates to
  the browser but only for the part of the app which changed.
* Typically your application is divided into modules - views, models, services,
  utility code. These modules are then packaged into one or a small number
  of JavaScript files using Browserify or Webpack which the browser loads.
* To go from editing code to updating the app, we need logic on the client
  and server. On the server, we need to generate an incremental update - effectively
  a mini-bundle that contains only the modules which changed.
* On the client, we need to fetch and apply that update.
* Implementations are available for Webpack and Browserify.
  If you have a new project, I'd recommend going with Webpack because
  this feature is part of the core and there is more documentation and sample
  code out there.

---

.full-slide-img[![Module Tree](images/module-tree.svg)]

???
- App is divided into JS modules which `require()` other modules,
  with one of the modules designated as the entry point,
  forming a dependency graph.

---

.full-slide-img[![Module Tree](images/module-tree-numbers.svg)]

???
- On disk the files require each other by name
- In the bundle, each module is instead assigned a number and file names
  in `require()` calls are mapped to numbers

---

class: middle

Anatomy of a Webpack Bundle*

```js
(function (modules) { /* bootstrap code */})([
  function(module, exports, require) { /* module 0 (entry point) */
    var dependency = require(1);
    var anotherDependency = require(2);
    ...
  },
  function(module, exports, require) { /* module 1 */ },
  function(module, exports, require) { /* module 2 */ },
  ...
])
```

*_Browserify_ bundles are very similar

???
- The structure of a Webpack or Browserify bundle is actually
  really simple - one big IIFE.
- Starts with a bootstrap function which creates the `require()` function
  and the module cache.
- The module cache is an object that maps module numbers to
  module functions. A module function is your original code for a module,
  wrapped in a function.
- As soon as the bundle loads, the bootstrap function is called with an array
  of functions as an argument.
- Each function is a module from your original code.
- Modules reference each other by index in the array.
- Hot updating involves removing any existing entry from the module cache
  and replacing it with the function object for the updated module.
- Updates need to be applied in the right order

---

Enabling hot reloading on the client

```js
webpack --hot
```

* Enables the 'Hot Module Runtime' plugin
* This adds an extra chunk of code to the bootstrap (the "HMR runtime")
* Provides functions for checking for updates and updating the module cache.

---

Initial build:

```sh
*Hash: 015b66e9275f10ef1b86
Version: webpack 1.12.12
Time: 2698ms
    Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
bundle.js  1.06 MB       0  [emitted]  main
```

In bundle.js:

```js
...
var hotApplyOnUpdate = true;
*var hotCurrentHash = "015b66e9275f10ef1b86";
var hotCurrentModuleData = {};
var hotCurrentParents = [];
...
```

???
- When the client checks for updates, it needs to indicate which
  version of the code it currently has, so it can download the right
  changes.
- When Webpack builds a bundle, it generates a compilation hash.
  This hash is embedded in the bundle itself.
- When checking for updates, Webpack will look for a JSON file on the server
  whose name includes the hash.

---

After a code change:

```sh
Hash: b444a862c30a14d36321
Version: webpack 1.12.12
Time: 318ms
                               Asset      Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
                           bundle.js   1.06 MB       0  [emitted]  main
0.015b66e9275f10ef1b86.hot-update.js    3.9 kB       0  [emitted]  main
015b66e9275f10ef1b86.hot-update.json  36 bytes          [emitted]
    + 427 hidden modules
```

Update manifest: CURRENT_HASH.hot-update.json

```js
{"h":"b444a862c30a14d36321","c":[0]}
```

Update content: CHUNK_ID.CURRENT_HASH.hot-update.js

```js
webpackHotUpdate(<chunk ID>, {
  <module ID>: function(module, exports, require) {
    // your new module code
  }
});
```

???
* When you make a code change, Webpack will perform an incremental build
  and if hot-module-reloading is enabled, it will also generate
  an _update manifest_ and _update chunk_
* The update manifest's name includes the previous compilation's hash,
  so the client can fetch it. Inside the manifest is the hash of the current
  compilation
* The compilation hashes link together the updates in a chain, enabling the
  client to fetch and apply them in the right order
* The update chunk is a mapping of module IDs to updated code for that module

---

# The client API

```js
// Exists if the hot reloading runtime is available
module.hot = {
  // Attempt to fetch an update manifest
  check()

  // Register a handler to be invoked
  // when 'dependency' or one of _its_
  // dependencies is updated
  accept(dependency, callback)

  // Register a handler to be called
  // when the module is unloaded
  addDisposeHandler(callback)
}
```

???
- If a module is built with hot reloading enabled, an additional `hot` property
  is added to the module object.
- Modules can use these to initiate a check for updates and also declare
  that they can accept updates for dependencies.

---

.full-slide-img[![Update Check](images/update-check.svg)]

???
- When the client receives an update, it marks each of the updated modules
  as outdated
- Each of the parents of that module is queried to see whether it can accept
  an update for that dependency, registered with `module.accept()`
- If the parent can accept the update, the parent's `module.accept()` callback
  is invoked.

---

.full-slide-img[![Update Check](images/update-check-2.svg)]

???
- If not, the parent itself is marked as outdated and the search continues up
  the tree, until we get to the root.
- In this case, 3 cannot handle updates for 7 itself, so the search continues
  up to the entry module.
- Module 0 _can_ handle the update and it will `require()` the new version of
  module '3', which will also load the new version of module '7' in the process.

---

# Updating Views

???
- So given the ability to load a new version of some code for a UI
  component, in order to hot-reload it, we need to update all of the DOM
  elements in the app to reflect the new version.
- React makes this easy
---

class:middle

React components are functions that return an object _describing_ what
should be in the DOM.

```js
function Button(props) {
  return <button onClick={props.onClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```

is equivalent to...

```js
function Button(props) {
  return {
    type: 'button',
    props: {
      onClick: props.onClick,
      children: 'Click me',
    },
    // a few other fields omitted
  }
}
```

???
- In a traditional MVC framework, replacing a component is a tricky thing to do
- You'd have to find all instances of a component on screen, remove their DOM
  elements, generate new ones using the updated code and insert them back in place.
- React components on the other hand are simply functions that return an
  object describing what the DOM should look like and what event handlers should
  be attached.
- This makes hot reloading much easier

---

# Updating views

App.js
```js
module.exports = function () {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
```

index.js
```js
var App = require('./App');
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

*module.hot.accept('./App', function () {
  App = require('./App');
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
});
```

???
- This is the "hot reloading" Hello World with React

---

class:middle

- If you are using Babel, the `react-transform-hmr` plugin can be used
  to rewrite your code at compile time to add `module.hot` calls and reload
  the component
- Caveat: `react-transform-hmr` does not yet support stateless function
  components.

???
- The reason why 'react-transform-hmr' does not support function components
  is interesting.

---

class: middle

- So that deals with updating the views, but how do we preserve
  the state of the application?
- What if we want to make changes to models as well as views?
- This is where Redux comes in

---

class: middle

- Inspired by _Elm_, a functional compile-to-JavaScript language.
- Components in Elm are stateless, just a collection of 3 functions

???
- Redux started as a project to enable hot reloading in
  a robust way.

---

class: middle

.large-slide-img[![Elm Component](images/elm-component.svg)]

???
- Redux is inspired by Elm and in particular a way of structuring a UI
  referred to as the 'Elm architecture'.
- A UI component in Elm consists of 3 pure functions: One to get the
  initial state for the component, one that takes the state and
  returns a description of the UI to render given that state and finally 
  one to get the new state given the current state and an action.
- An 'action' is something like a mouse click, or a WebSocket message
- Important to notice for hot reloading: Component is entirely pure. Contains
  the logic to manage the state but doesn't store it. Therefore, to do
  a hot reload, we just need to change the arrows on the left to point
  to the new version.

---

.large-slide-img[![Elm Component](images/elm-component-reload-1.svg)]

???
- Since the component is pure, in order to replace it with a new version
  at runtime, all we need to do is redirect the input arrows that feed
  state updates and the action signal into it to point to the new
  version

---

.large-slide-img[![Elm Component](images/elm-component-reload-2.svg)]

---

class: middle

.large-slide-img[![React/Redux Component](images/react-redux-component.svg)]

???
- By constrast, this is the architecture of React/Redux
- The data flow is the same. The main difference is that
  whereas in Elm the three functions are part of the same component,
  here the view part is React, the update/init parts are merged together
  into a single 'reducer' function in Redux
- The view and reducer components are still pure, so hot reloading works
  the same way

---

# Three Basic Principles

1 - Store all of your application's state in a single, immutable object.

```js
{
  charts: [{
    repository: 'facebook/react',
    isLoading: false,
    data: [...],
  },
    ...
  ],
  focusedChart: 0,
}
```

_Better yet: Make it a **plain JavaScript object**_

???
- The first principle is that the state of your app is stored in a single,
  immutable object, separate from the logic that updates it.
- This enables a lot of useful debug tools on its own. For example,
  you can easily expose the store as a property on the 'window' object
  for easy inspection in dev tools.
{Show state in demo app}
- Why immutable? That enforces that there is only one way to update it.

---

2 - The only way to change the state is by calling a `dispatch()` function
    with an 'action', which is just a plain JavaScript object describing
    what happened.

   ```js
   function setRepository(name) {
     return {
       type: 'SET_REPOSITORY',
       repository: name,
     };
   }

   // in the 'onSubmit' handler for the form where the user
   // chooses a repository to view
   store.dispatch(setRepository(name));
   ```

---

3 - State updates are made by a collection of functions (called 'reducers'),
    which take the current state, the action and return the new state.

```js
var initialState = {
  repository: undefined,
};

function chart(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_REPOSITORY':
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        repository: action.repository,
      });
    default:
      return state || initialState;
  }
}
```

???
- State updates happen by calling a function on the store, `dispatch()`
  and passing it an object describing what happened.
- In our example app, we have actions for the user selecting a repository,
  data being fetched from the GitHub API and the user zooming into or out
  of a chart.
  {Show actions in debug tools}

---

# The Redux API

```js
createStore(reducer, initialState);

store: {
  dispatch: function(action) {
    // call reducer(getState(), action) and replace
    // the state with the result
  },

  subscribe: function(listener) {
    // add a listener which will be called whenever the
    // state changes
  },

  getState: function() {
    // returns the current state of the application
  },

  replaceReducer: function (reducer) {
    // replace the 'reducer' function, this enables
    // live code updates
  }
}
```

???
- The basic API of a store is extremely simple. Call `createStore()` and
  get back an object with functions to get the current state of the app,
  list for state changes, and dispatch actions to trigger state changes.
---

# Poor man's hot reloading

- Persist state to `window.localStorage` or `window.hash`
- Restore on load

```js
var initialState = JSON.parse(atob(window.location.hash.slice(1)) || 'null');
var store = redux.createStore(rootReducer, initialState);

store.subscribe(function () {
  window.location.hash = JSON.stringify(btoa(store.getState()));
});
```

???
- By storing all our app state in a single object, we can already implement
  a simple hot reloading hack.
- Every time the app state changes, we'll serialize it and put it in
  `window.hash`
- If we reload the app, we'll deserialize that state.
{Let's go and try it out!}

---

# Hot Reloading with Redux

```js
var reducer = require('./rootReducer');

if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./rootReducer', function () {
    reducer = require('./rootReducer');
    store.replaceReducer(reducer);
  });
}
```

???
- Redux provides a `replaceReducer()` API which lets you replace the reducer
  function.
- If you have the dev tools enabled, all of the actions will be replayed,
  allowing you to see the effects of reducer changes live.
- { Demo fixing bug when resetting repo whilst zoomed in }

---

# Challenges

???
- This covers the basics, now I'll take a look at aspects of
  hot reloading and React/Redux which are still maturing and
  problems you might run into.

---

# Error handling

???
- This is JavaScript. It may shock you to learn that even after Babel
  compiles it, it may still have bugs.
- What happens if an exception is thrown whilst trying to load the new code?

--

- React will get stuck in a broken state if component render function  throws
- Wrap `render()` method to catch errors and render a fallback instead.
- The `react-transform-catch-errors` Babel plugin will do this for you
- Improvements ("error boundaries") coming in v0.15

???
- Out of the box, React currently does not cope very well.
- If a component throws an error whilst rendering, React will get stuck in
  an invalid internal state where subsequent renders will fail.
- Fortunately, since components are just functions, you can wrap them with
  another function which catches the exception and renders something else.
  {DEMO}

---

class: middle

```js
function catchErrors(Component) {
  var wrapped = function () {
    try {
      // try to render the component normally
      return Component.apply(this, arguments);
    } catch (err) {
      // something went wrong, replace it with a big red box
      // displaying the error message and stack trace
      return <ErrorBox name={Component.name} error={err}/>;
    }
  };
  wrapped.displayName = Component.name;
  return wrapped;
}

MyComponent = catchErrors(MyComponent)
```

???
{Live demo of error handling}

---

- Redux on the other hand copes much better
- If a reducer throws, you just get the previous state back

```js
// createStore.js

function dispatch(action) {
  ...
  try {
    isDispatching = true
    currentState = currentReducer(currentState, action)
  } finally {
    // ... something went wrong, currentState will simply
    // remain unchanged
    isDispatching = false
  }
  ...
}
```
???
- Thanks to the store being immutable and state changes happening via
  pure functions, Redux copes much better.
- If a reducer throws, the state remains unchanged. You can then just fix
  your code and reload the app
- If a bug results in corrupt state in the store, you can fix this by replaying
  all of the actions.

---

# State outside your app and the DOM

- `setInterval()`
- Async sequences

???
- In event handlers, you might kick off a series of async actions which
  might dispatch actions as a result.
- Changes to this code typically isn't reflected until the next time you trigger
  the action.

---

# Summary

- Hot reloading is a useful productivity tool, but really just one of
  many productivity/debugging tools enabled by the architecture
- Robust hot reloading is not just a build system feature, needs
  an app architecture that separates state and logic
